    <h2>Mahatma Gandhi Sarvodaya Sangh</h2>
    <p>
    Dr. Manibhai Desai, a devoted follower of Mahatma Gandhi, came along with Gandhiji to the village of Uruli Kanchan and chose to stay there permanently. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s thoughts and dedicated to rural development, Dr. Manibhai Desai established the Mahatma Gandhi Sarvodaya Sangh in 1950 at Uruli Kanchan.

The primary objective of this organization is to work for the overall development of people living in rural areas. As a part of this mission, and to ensure educational facilities for students in Uruli Kanchan and nearby villages, the institution was formally registered in 1952.

The organization, committed to rural development, education, healthcare, and self-reliance, has made significant contributions in the field of education. In 1952, it established Mahatma Gandhi Vidyalaya. In 1976, Mahatma Gandhi Junior College was founded, and in 2002, Padmashri Manibhai Desai College was established.

The institution also founded Dr. Cyrus Poonawalla English Medium School in 2010, and earlier in 2000, the B. G. Shirke Pre-Primary School and Mahatma Gandhi Primary School were established.

More than eight thousand students are currently studying in this educational campus, and the institution has educated several generations over the years. Many of its students have made remarkable achievements even at the national level.

In recognition of Dr. Manibhai Desai’s social work, the Government of India honored him with the Padma Shri award in 1968, and in 1982 he was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award, considered the Nobel Prize of Asia. He was also honored with the Jamnalal Bajaj Award and several other notable awards.

The institution founded by him is celebrating its Amrit Mahotsav in 2027, and the reputation it enjoys today is undoubtedly the result of the dedication and commitment of every individual associated with it.

Affiliated with Savitribai Phule Pune University, the college has earned recognition as a notable institution in this rural area. In 2027, the college will complete 25 years of its establishment, and various activities are planned to celebrate the Silver Jubilee year.

Currently, the college offers the following courses under the Savitribai Phule Pune University. The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) has been adopted by the Government of Maharashtra for the first year of undergraduate programs from the academic year 2024–25, following the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS). This policy will be applicable for the second-year classes from the academic year 2025–26.
